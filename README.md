<h1>What is REX?</h1>
R3X is a runtime environment for portable applications. it has currently been ported to x86, x86-64, and ARM architectures.<br>
<br>
R3X programs are compiled to it's own bytecode, which can be run using the VM and are architecture independent.<br>
The main goal for R3X is to create an environment which offers maximum portability, while ensuring performance and features.<br>
R3X aims to provide a C-like enviroment, at the same time being highly portable and safe.<br>
It currently supports streams, exception handling, multithreading, dynamic memory allocation and dynamic linking<br>
The VM also comes with an inbuilt debugger<br>
<br>
An compiler toolchain for the R3X architecture is currently in progress. See the 'rcc' directory for progress<br>
See docs/REX.html for more details.<br>

Good news! We're finally stable! 0.1.7b stable (Crispy Pie) has been released.<br>
