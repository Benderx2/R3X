						PROTOCOL FOR ESOTERIC MINIMALISM AND AVOIDANCE OF THE TURING TARPIT (PEMATT)
										PROTOTYPE
										 DRAFT-I
BASIC STRUCTURE:

The system consists of a stack, which shall be used for storing data. The data, on the other hand, can be of four types: 

* Integer-type
* Floating Point-type
* ASCII String-type
* Code-type

The code shall have the ability through various instructions to act on these values, and also to act on the stack.
There shall be no registers in the esoteric CPU, with the exception of the instruction pointer, and the stack pointer. 
The CPU instructions shall be only of one-byte length and in ASCII only.

There must be strict type checking, implemented within the CPU. All type errors must be handled like exceptions. 
(which shall be discussed later)

INSTRUCTIONS:
	CHARACTER (ASCII)					DESCRIPTION
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	>							Increase top stack pointer by 1
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	<							Decrease top of stack pointer by 1
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	(...)							Push string, float, integer or code to stack and increment the stack pointer.
								enclosed in '()'.
								Integers must be prefixed with 'i', e.g.: (i247) to push the integer 247. They can also
								be prefixed with 'x' or 'b' to indicate hexadecimal or binary. e.g: (xEFF) or (b1110111).
								You can also push the address of labels, simply by using the 'l' prefix e.g: (l"mylabel")
								Strings must be prefixed with 's' and enclosed in '"'. e.g: (s"Hello, World!"), to push
								the string "Hello, World!"
								Floats must be prefixed with 'f', the non-whole part is to be separated from the whole by a
								'.'. All floats MUST use the decimal system. e.g: (f23.7)
								The 'Code' type contains code, which can be called through various instructions explained later 
								on, they must be prefixed with 'c' and be enclosed within '"', e.g: (c"<<(i247)")
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	+							Add/Concatenate items. Depending upon type, do an add or concatenate, and pop both the items,
								pushing the result.
								Let a be the item right on stack pointer, and b be the item right on stack pointer - 1.
								*If both a and b are integers, then push: b+a
								*If both a and b are floats, then push: b+a
								*If a is an integer and b is a float, then convert a to float, and push b+a
								*If a is a float and b is an integer, round of a to an integer, and push b+a
								*If both a and b are strings or code, concatenate a and b, and push result.
								*If a is a string, and b is a integer, attempt to convert a to integer, and push b+a. If there
								is an error in conversion, cause an exception.
								*If a is an integer or float and b is a string, convert a to string, and concatenate a and b, pushing
								the result
								*If a is code and b is an integer or float, error out.
								*If b is code, and a is an integer or float, error out.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	-							Subtract/Remove items. Depending upon type, do a subtract or removal operation, and pop both items,
								pushing result.
								Let a be the item right on stack pointer, and b be the item right on stack pointer - 1.
								*If both a and b are integers, then push: b-a
								*If both a and b are floats, then push: b-a
								*If a is an integer and b is a float, then convert a to float, and push b-a
								*If a is a float and b is an integer, round off a to an integer, and push b-a
								*If both a and b are strings or code, remove all instance of 'a' from 'b' and push the result.
								*If a is a string, and b is a integer, attempt to convert a to integer, and push b-a. If there
								is an error in conversion, cause an exception.
								*If a is an integer or float and b is a string, convert a to string, and remove all instance of a
								from b, pushing the result
								*If a is code and b is an integer or float, error out.
								*If b is code, and a is an integer or float, error out.
	------------------------------------------------------------------

								*If a is an integer and b is a float, then convert a to float, and push b*a
								*If a is a float and b is an integer, round off a to an integer, and push b*a
								*Error out on all other circumstances
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	/							Divide operation.
								Let a be the item right on stack pointer, and b be the item right on stack pointer - 1.
								*If both a and b are integers, then push: b/a
								*If both a and b are floats, then push: b/a
								*If a is an integer and b is a float, then convert a to float, and push b/a

								*If a is a float and b is an integer, round off a to an integer, and push b%a
								*Error out on all other circumstances
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	R							Right Shift operation (>>)
								Let a be the item right on stack pointer, and b be the item right on stack pointer - 1.
								*If both a and b are integers, then push: b>>a
								*If both a and b are floats, then push: b>>a
								(NOTE: FLOATS WILL BE CONVERTED TO IEEE-754 ENCODING PRIOR TO BITWISE OPERATION, AND WOULD
								THEN BE CONVERTED BACK TO FLOATING POINT DECIMALS AFTER THE OPERATION HAS BEEN DONE.)
								*Error out on all other circumstances
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	L							Left shift operation (<<)
								Let a be the item right on stack pointer, and b be the item right on stack pointer - 1.
								*If both a and b are integers, then push: b<<a
								*If both a and b are floats, then push: b<<a
								(NOTE: FLOATS WILL BE CONVERTED TO IEEE-754 ENCODING PRIOR TO BITWISE OPERATION, AND WOULD
								THEN BE CONVERTED BACK TO FLOATING POINT DECIMALS AFTER THE OPERATION HAS BEEN DONE.)
								*Error out on all other circumstances
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	A							Do a bitwise AND (&) operation						
								Let a be the item right on stack pointer, and b be the item right on stack pointer - 1.
								*If both a and b are integers, then push: b&a
								*If both a and b are floats, then push: b&a
								(NOTE: FLOATS WILL BE CONVERTED TO IEEE-754 ENCODING PRIOR TO SHIFT OPERATION, AND WOULD
								THEN BE CONVERTED BACK TO FLOATING POINT DECIMALS AFTER THE OPERATION HAS BEEN DONE.)
								*Error out on all other circumstances
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	O							Do a bitwise OR (|) operation						
								Let a be the item right on stack pointer, and b be the item right on stack pointer - 1.
								*If both a and b are integers, then push: b|a
								*If both a and b are floats, then push: b|a

								THEN BE CONVERTED BACK TO FLOATING POINT DECIMALS AFTER THE OPERATION HAS BEEN DONE.)
								*Error out on all other circumstances
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	^							Do a bitwise XOR(^) operation.
								Let a be the item right on stack pointer, and b be the item right on stack pointer - 1.
								*If both a and b are integers, then push: b^a
								*If both a and b are floats, then push: b^a
								(NOTE: FLOATS WILL BE CONVERTED TO IEEE-754 ENCODING PRIOR TO BITWISE OPERATION, AND WOULD
								THEN BE CONVERTED BACK TO FLOATING POINT DECIMALS AFTER THE OPERATION HAS BEEN DONE.)
								*Error out on all other circumstances
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	!							Do a bitwise NOT. If a is the item right on stack pointer, pop a, and push '!a'.
								(i.e. if a is equal to 0, push 1, else push 0)
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	D							Duplicate value. If a is the item right on stack pointer, pop a, and push a twice.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	W							sWap values on top of stack. Let a be value right on stack pointer, and b be value on
										stack pointer - 1. Then, pop a, then b, and then push a and b, hence reversing the order.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	?							Push random value on stack.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	$							Pop from stack, decrease top of stack pointer by 1.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	J							Set instruction pointer to the integer pushed last to stack.
								If instead of an integer, the top of stack contains 'code', prepare
								a new execution instance and copy the code popped from stack, and duplicate the stack of the current
								instance, and execute the code on the newer execution instance. Once the newer
								instance has quit, copy it's stack, and place it on the main execution instance, and continue. 
								Error out, if string or float is found.  Pop the value.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	C							Call from class. A class is a mere set of functions.
								The 'E' instruction works similar to 'J', except it takes the argument as a string pushed
								last to stack in the form of: "classname.function"
								Where 'classname' is the name of the class (file) with the extension '.pt', and 'function'
								is a function defined in that file. The 'E' instruction calls that function in the same way
								as 'J' does. If you want to call a function from the current module, simply use: 'self.function'.
								The function name will be popped from stack. Errors out if the function is not found, or the value
								pushed to stack is not string.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	Z							If top of stack is 0, do what instruction 'J' does.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	=							Let a be the item right on stack pointer, and b be the item right on stack pointer - 1.
										If a is equal to b, push 0, else push 1. Pop the values.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	G							Let a be the item right on stack pointer, and b be the item right on stack pointer - 1.
								If b is greater than a, push 0, else push 1.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	L							Let a be the item right on stack pointer, and b be the item right on stack pointer - 1.
								If b is lesser than a, push 0, else push 1.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	E							External call. Call function from the environment, whose name is pushed to stack. Pop the name,
								and push the result from the function. (List of functions available coming up!)
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	l							Load from memory address. The memory address must be on top of stack. The address will be
								popped from stack and the value at the address will be pushed.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	s							Store to memory address. The memory address should be on stack pointer - 1 and MUST be
								an integer and valid memory address, while the value to be stored must be right on stack pointer. 
								Depending upon type (integer, string, code or float) would be stored appropriately.
								Both should be popped out after store.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	I							Get current instruction pointer and push to stack.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	a							Allocate memory. The amount of bytes to be allocated must be on top of stack.
								Push the address, and pop the amount of bytes after allocation
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	@							An 'END' statement. Ends the current execution instance.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	o							Output string/float/integer pushed to stack (depending upon type) and pop it.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	i							Take input from user, until a '\n' is received and push string to stack.
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	g							Set global variable whose name is right on stack pointer - 1 and value on stack pointer.
								If types don't match, the interpreter shall error out. The name must be in the format:
								'classname.variable'; If the interpreter does not find such a variable, it must error out.
								After the assignment, both the values must be pushed to stack.

PREPROCESSOR:
	
	The preprocessor forms a very important part of the PEMATT protocol, through this, programs can use features
	that are not available in most esoteric languages. After preprocessing the preprocessor directives are removed
	from code, and their infromation is stored internally.
	
	PHRASE						DESCRIPTION
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	#import "classname.pt"				Import a class. (Just like include)
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	:...:						Declare label. The interpreter is supposed to remove this from code during the preprocessing, 
							and assign the name to it's address internally. It shall function as a indicator of the memory
							address right after the second ':'. NOTE: The label MUST not be a part of the memory during execution.
							This works exactly like the label system in assemblers.
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	#def "functionname" { code }			Define a function with name as code within '{' and '}'. 
							This can then be called using the 'S' instruction.
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	#global "varname"				Declare a global variable with name
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	#init						Compulsory. Indication of where the execution is supposed to begin in script.
