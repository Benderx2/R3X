The project began in the November of 2014, as a hobbyist's attempt at studying virtual machines. Since then, the project has moved quite ahead, and is very functional. There is indeed quite a lot of complications and technical errors, but it is improving. The <i>runtime environment</i> features a debugger, a fully capable instruction set, a standard library, a compiler and a small terminal emulator which uses OpenGL capabilities. \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
