TODO: Stuff that needs to be done
HI = High priority, ME = Medium, LO = Low.
[HI] 1. Remove shitty build.sh and use a proper build system.
[LO] 2. Remove useless comments
[ME] 3. Don't USE redundant typecasts
[ME] 4. Proper whitespacing
[X] 5. Remove 'r3x_' prefix from source files -- Fixed
[X] 6. Make typecasting mechanism local. -- Fixed
[HI] 7. Print errors to stderr not to stdout.
[HI] 8. 'fopen' returns null on not just file ceasing to exist. Add a proper message
[ME] 9. Stop using different case styles, use either normal_case, CamelCase, or cameCase.
[X] 10. Use something like a debug macro, to fix nt_malloc_init -- Fixed
[LO] 11. Stop using swear words.
[X] 12. Stop using multiple printfs --- Fixed
[ME] 13. Fix identation
[HI] 14. Remove useless 'else' statements
[LO] 15. Remove offensive error messages (Keep it down)
[HI] 16. Use a standard header for endianess (<endian.h>), remove big_endian.h
[Too high to describe] 17. Write standard-compliant code.
[X] 18. Rewrite include guards, to not use reserved prefixes. -- Fixed
[HI] 19. Rewrite big_endian.h to use <byteswap.h>
[HI] 20. Remove all references to R3X_BIG_ENDIAN, and use a common function to read a 32-bit integer from memory.
[ME] 21. Show message for big endian machines too. Use a common function to read as above. -- Partially Fixed
[HI] 22. Remove the little malloc wrapper. It's problematic.
[ME] 23. Remove /fasm/ directory and use git's submodule system to link it to fasm's repository.
[HI] 24. Use strdup() instead of manually using malloc to create duplicate of strings
[ME] 25. Remove useless binaries from /src/ directory.
[ME] 26. Use the current directory, (and not the executable directory) for devenv.
[HI] 27. Don't use strncmp for comparision, since it works without error on things like ("helpppppppp" instead of showing an error message)
[HI] 28. Update "r3x_version.h" to simply have 1 name for all architectures, use standard functions to detect system rather than manually specifying it.
[Too high to describe] 29. Improve code overall, try to make it more readable, at the same time run with decent performance.
[X] 30. Exit on not receiving arguments --> Fixed.
[HI] 31. Use size_t instead of 'int' while comparing return values from strlen.
[X] 32. Add license headers in each file. Maybe remove the license in "help" option too. -- Fixed 
[X] 33. Add a stack overflow check. --Fixed
