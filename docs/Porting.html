<h1>REX Virtual Machine Documentation</h1>
<h2>Porting the R3X Virtual Machine</h2>
As a program that makes use of multithreading, OpenGL and dynamic linking, R3X may<br>
seem to require a lot of dependencies, but this can be minimized.<br>
There are a few defines which can change the course of compilation, here is<br>
a small list of them:<br>
<pre>REX_GRAPHICS</pre>
Defines whether to use SDL/OpenGL/X11 libraries, note that compilations without using<br>
this would have problems with user input. This bug is currently being fixed.<br>
<pre>R_DEBUG</pre>
Defines whether to print debugging information or not<br>
<pre>REX_DYNAMIC</pre>
Defines whether to use dynamic linking (note: VM compiled without this would not be able to run programs using native linking)<br>
<pre>LITTLE_ENDIAN</pre>
If this macro is defined, the VM assumes that the target is little endian<br>
<pre>BIG_ENDIAN</pre>
If this macro is defined, the VM assumes that the target is big endian<br>
<pre>LINUX_ARCH_X8664, LINUX_ARCH_X8632, LINUX_ARCH_AARCH64, LINUX_ARCH_PPC</pre>
Target set to the corresponding defines above<br>
<h3>Compilers supported</h3>
Officially supported compilers are: gcc (4.8.1), gcc (4.8.2), gcc (4.9.0), clang (3.4), clang (3.5)<br>
<h3>Officially supported operating systems</h3>
The officially supported operating system currently is Linux. The program has been successfully tested on Linux (x86), Linux (x64),<br> 
Linux (ARM64), and Linux (PowerPC).<br>
Support for Windows (x86 and x64) is planned.<br>
<h3>OS Specific routines</h3>
R3X does not need much from the target operating system except for a standard C library. (*printf, string routines, memory allocation, streams, signals)<br>
However, there is one special OS specific routine defined in "src/main.c"<br>
<pre>
void GetApplicationPath(void) { 
	#ifdef __linux__
	#ifndef FILENAME_MAX
	#warning "Assuming max filename as 1024 bytes"
	char buf[1024];
	#else 
	char buf[FILENAME_MAX];
	#endif
	memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
	/* Note we use sizeof(buf)-1 since we may need an extra char for NUL. */
	if (readlink("/proc/self/exe", buf, sizeof(buf)-1) &lt 0)
	{
		/* There was an error...  Perhaps the path does not exist
		* or the buffer is not big enough.  errno has the details. */
		perror("readlink");
		printf("FATAL: Unable to read /proc/self/exe!");
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}
	ApplicationPath = strdup(buf);
	for(size_t i = strlen(ApplicationPath); i != 0; i--){
		// Backwards babe...
		/** Remove the executable name from the path **/
		if(ApplicationPath[i] == '/'){
			memset((char*)((intptr_t)ApplicationPath + i), 0, strlen(ApplicationPath)-i);
			return;
		}
	}
	#else 
	#error "GetApplicationPath unimplemented for target, please write your own implementation"
	#endif
}
</pre>
The "GetApplicationPath" supposed to get the <i><b>absolute</b></i> path to the directory of the VM executable<br>
and the store it in a string (char*) called "ApplicationPath".<br>
The string is uninitialized, which means that the routine must do the allocation itself.<br>
Also, if no "GetApplicationPath" is implemented for target, the program uses an enviroment variable called 'RX_DIR_ENV'.<br>
This must be exported as "the executable path" of the program before executing the program.<br>
<h3>Required headers</h3>
The R3X VM requires the following headers for a <b>minimal</b> compilation. They are '#included' from src/include/system.h<br>
<pre>
&lt;assert.h&gt;
&lt;math.h&gt;
&lt;stdio.h&gt;
&lt;stdlib.h&gt;
&lt;stdint.h&gt;
&lt;string.h&gt;
&lt;stdbool.h&gt;
&lt;signal.h&gt;
&lt;stdarg.h&gt;
&lt;unistd.h&gt;
</pre>
The following are required to compile with <b>optimization</b> support:<br>
<pre>
&lt;pthread.h&lt;
</pre>
The following are required to compile with <b>native linking</b> support:<br>
<pre>
&lt;dlfcn.h&gt;
&lt;execinfo.h&gt;
</pre>
The following are required to compile with <b>graphics</b> support:<br>
<pre>
&lt;SDL/SDL.h&gt;
&lt;SDL/SDL_image.h&gt;
&lt;GL/gl.h&gt;
&lt;GL/glew.h&gt;
&lt;X11/xlib.h&gt; -> Can be removed, simply comment the line 'XInitThreads()" under graphics.c
</pre>
