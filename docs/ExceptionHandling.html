<h1>REX Virtual Machine Documentation</h1>
<h2>Exception Handling</h2>
Exception Handling in the REX architecture is in it's very early stages, however<br>
it is fully functional.<br>
<h3>Kinds of exceptions</h3>
As of now, there are 3 types of exceptions that can be handled, they are given below<br>
INVALID_ACCESS - Invalid Memory Access<br>
INVALID_OPCODE - Invalid Instruction <br>
R_EXCEP - Program defined exception <br>
<h3>Handling Exceptions</h3>
Exceptions can be handled by assigning them with specific handlers, using the "catch" instruction.<br>
Example Usage: <br>
<pre>
push handler_address
push R_EXCEP/INVALID_ACCESS/INVALID_OPCODE --- Exception ID
catch
popn 2 ; Optional but recommended
</pre>
<h3>Throwing custom exceptions</h3>
The INVALID_ACCESS/INVALID_OPCODE exceptions are caused when a program does an invalid memory access or<br>
executes an unknown instruction. But there are a third type of exception as shown above: "R_EXCEP"<br>
The 'throw' instruction is used to intentionally cause an exception. Example usage show below:<br>
<pre>
push error_code
push R_EXCEP
throw
</pre>
One advice would be to 'pop' out the exception ID at the start of the handler, which would make the error_code at the top of stack.<br>
An example is shown in src/programs/exception.asm
<h3>The 'handle' instruction</h3>
The 'handle' instruction informs the CPU that the exception has been handled successfully. When an exception is thrown, the CPU<br>
sets the Exception Flag (EXF) to true. This means that any exception that is caused when the exception flag is set to true, would<br>
make the VM shutdown. This helps when the exception handlers themselves are bogus.<br>
Before resuming execution, the exception handler, must execute the 'handle' instruction, which sets the exception flag to false.<br>
If you fail to do this, the VM would simply shutdown with a "bad handler" message, if another exception is caused<br>

<h3>Stack Overflow</h3>
When a program causes a stack overflow exception, the virtual machine will simply return control to the debugger, giving a message<br>
telling the user that the stack has exceeded it's limit. The size of the stack can be specified using the "-stack" option. Please
see the "Building and Running" section about this option. The default stack size of assumed to be 262144 32-bit integers<br>
