<h1 align="center">R3X Virtual Machine</h1>
<p>R3X is an experiment to rebuild an entire runtime environment (like JVM) from scratch. 
The project began in the November of 2014, as a hobbyist's attempt at studying virtual machines. 
Since then, the project has moved quite ahead, and is very functional. There is indeed quite a 
lot of complications and technical errors, but it continues to improve. The <i>runtime environment</i> 
features a debugger, a fully capable instruction set, a standard library, a compiler and a small 
terminal emulator which uses OpenGL capabilities.<br><br>

The current version of the R3X runtime environment is 0.4.8a codename: <i>Cheesy Blueberry</i> (unstable).
There has been considerable progress on the graphics library, and the standard library is fully functional,
although some features are still missing. Most of the bugs have been identified and resolved, and the compiler
(and programming language) are now quite useful with the arrival of the standard library.<br><br>

R3X programs are compiled to an architecture independent format, which can be run using the VM 
and are architecture independent. The main goal for R3X is to create an environment which offers maximum portability,
while ensuring performance and features. It currently supports I/O, exception handling, multithreading, and dynamic linking.
The runtime also comes with an inbuilt debugger, which has an integrated disassembler, stack tracing, 
and a lot of nifty features.<br><br>

The total R3X source contains 57,377 lines of code (which includes ANSI C, T++, SH and Assembly), the first
version of the project, in comparision contained 1,714 lines of code. That is a 3247.5% increase within just
8 months. Below is a graph of the project's SLOC count history.<br><br>

You can notice from the graph the project is continously being worked on and improved. There is still a long
way to, with so many shortcomings, but as said before, the project continues to get better. <br><br>
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ol>
<li type="disc">Fully capable instruction set (conditionals, arithmetic, stack, floating point)</li>
<li type="disc">Integrated Debugger</li>
<li type="disc">Exception handling</li>
<li type="disc">A small terminal emulator (input/output) using OpenGL</li>
<li type="disc">Portable (has been tested on PPC, ARM, x86, and x64 [Windows and Linux])</li>
<li type="disc">High Level Programming language (T++, a BASIC-like programming language)</li>
<li type="disc">Standard Library for T++ (includes math, sockets, File I/O, and string handling)</li>
<li type="disc">Functional Toolchain (including compiler, disassembler, executable information dump etc.)</li>
<li type="disc">Dynamic Linking and Native Linking for R3X programs</li>
<li type="disc">A server-like implementation which can run multiple instances of VMs</li>
<li type="disc">Own configure script system for VM</li>
</ol>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
Since, R3X is a hobby project, it does not aim to as featureful unlike JVM or .NET, which are platforms
designed by large corporations for professional use. This introduces quite a lot of limitations, a few of them
are given below:<br><br>
</p>
<ol>
<li type="disc">No graphics library. (There is an WIP OpenGL wrapper)</li>
<li type="disc"><b>No JIT</b> compilation. All code is interpreted. <b>No optimisations</b> either.</li>
<li type="disc">Compiler produces very unoptimised code</li>
<li type="disc">Limited error handling (compiler) and very crude output</li>
<li type="disc">No assembler, R3X currently uses FASM as it's backend assembler</li>
<li type="disc">Programming language does not provide error handling (although the instruction set allows it)</li>
<li type="disc">Escape sequences are not supported by the compiler</li>
<li type="disc">No IDE</li>
<li type="disc">Terminal emulator is very limited, no colors either.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
The R3X runtime is very minimal, and hence the system requirements are very low, the following are the <i>minimum</i> requirements
for the runtime:<br>
<ol>
<li type="disc">256 Megabytes of RAM (512 if using with OpenGL)</li>
<li type="disc">Intel Pentium or greater CPU</li>
<li type="disc">If using GL, a GPU is recommended, rendering large blocks of text is often slow on integrated GPUs/software rendering.</li>
<li type="disc">A Linux System (recommended), R3X has not been tested throughly on Windows systems, and the build process is very UNIX-y</li>
<li type="disc">Space requirements are tiny, R3X does not consume more than 5 Megabytes of storage (along with the standard library and toolchain)</li>
</ol>
</p>
